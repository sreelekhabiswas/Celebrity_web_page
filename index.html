        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Cruise was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV in Syracuse, New York, on
          July 3, 1962, the son of special education teacher Mary Lee (née
          Pfeiffer; 1936–2017) and electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother
          III (1934–1984). His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and
          had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Cruise has three sisters
          named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his cousins, William
          Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside Cruise in five
          films. Cruise grew up in near poverty and had a Catholic upbringing.
          He later described his father as "a merchant of chaos", a "bully", and
          a "coward" who beat his children. He elaborated, "[My father] was the
          kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a
          great lesson in my life—how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and
          then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this
          guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'"

        <p>
          In 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood's most powerful actor, as
          Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine's 2006 Power List, being
          the highest ranked actor. The same year, Forbes magazine ranked him as
          the world's most powerful celebrity. The founder of CinemaScore in
          2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the "two stars, it doesn't
          matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up".
          October 10, 2006, was declared "Tom Cruise Day" in Japan; the Japan
          Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day
          because of "his love for and close association with Japan." While
          reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the
          similarities between several of Cruise's 1980s films and nicknamed the
          formula the Tom Cruise Picture. Ebert listed nine key ingredients that
          make up the Tom Cruise Picture; the Cruise character, the mentor, the
          superior woman, the craft he must hone, the arena it takes place in,
          the arcana or knowledge he must learn, the trail or journey, the proto
          enemy, and the eventual enemy of the character. Some of Cruise's later
          films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered
          to be part of this formula.

        <h2>Films</h2>

          Tom Cruise is an American actor and producer who made his film debut
          with a minor role in the 1981 romantic drama Endless Love. His
          breakthrough role was in the coming-of-age comedy Risky Business
          (1983), which garnered Cruise his first nomination for the Golden
          Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In
          1986, Cruise played a fighter pilot in the Tony Scott-directed action
          drama Top Gun (the highest-grossing film that year), and also appeared
          with Paul Newman in the Martin Scorsese-directed drama The Color of
          Money. Two years later, he starred with Dustin Hoffman in the Academy
          Award for Best Picture-winning drama Rain Man (1988), and also
          appeared in the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture-winning
          romantic drama Cocktail (1988). In doing so Cruise became the first
          and only person as of 2014 to star in a Best Picture Oscar winner and
          a Worst Picture Razzie winner in the same year. His next role was as
          anti-war activist Ron Kovic in the film adaptation of Kovic's memoir
          of the same name, Born on the Fourth of July (1989), for which he
          received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.
          In 1992, he starred opposite Jack Nicholson in the legal drama A Few
          Good Men, an adaptation of the Broadway play of the same name also
          written by Aaron Sorkin. Cruise next appeared in The Firm (1993), a
          film adaptation of the John Grisham legal thriller of the same name,
          and in the same year also made his directorial debut by directing an
          episode of the anthology television series Fallen Angels. Cruise
          starred as spy Ethan Hunt in the action film Mission: Impossible
          (1996), the first project of his production company Cruise/Wagner
          Productions, which he had co-founded with Paula Wagner in 1993. As of
          2018, Cruise has appeared in five more films in the Mission:
          Impossible franchise: Mission: Impossible 2 (2000), Mission:
          Impossible III (2006), Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011),
          Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015), and Mission: Impossible –
          Fallout (2018).
